```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(gapminder)  # gapminder dataset
library(here)
```

We have seen the `gapminder` dataset that has data on life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for 142 countries from 1952 to 2007. To get a glipmse of the dataframe, namely to see the variable names, variable types, etc., we use the `glimpse` function. We also want to have a look at the first 20 rows of data.

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) # look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe

```

Our task is to produce two graphs of how life expectancy has changed over the years for the `country` and the `continent` I come from. 

I have created the `country_data` and `continent_data` with the code below. 

```{r}
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "China") 

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Asia")
```

First, create a plot of life expectancy over time for the single country I chose. 

```{r, lifeExp_one_country}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp))+geom_point() +geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+NULL 

plot1
```

Next we need to add a title. Create a new plot, or extend plot1, using the `labs()` function to add an informative title to the plot.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country_with_label}
plot1<- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+geom_point() +geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +labs(title = "Life Expectancy of China Over Time ",x = "year ",y = "life expectancy ") +NULL


print(plot1)
```


Secondly, produce a plot for all countries in the *continent* I come from.   

```{r lifeExp_one_continent}
ggplot(data = continent_data  , mapping = aes(x =year  , y = lifeExp , colour=country))+geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +NULL
```

Finally, using the original `gapminder` data, produce a life expectancy over time graph, grouped (or faceted) by continent. We will remove all legends, adding the `theme(legend.position="none")` in the end of our ggplot.

```{r lifeExp_facet_by_continent}
ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year  , y = lifeExp  , colour= country ))+geom_point() + 
geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +facet_wrap(~continent) +
theme(legend.position="none") + NULL
```

>Because China just ended the Second World War and civil war, the life expectancy of China in 1950s was relatively low. And the poor economic condition and lack of medical service also led to the low life expectancy. And after the founding of New China, the economic development and the construction of the medical service system down to the countryside greatly enhanced the life expectancy of China. In late 1970s, with Chinaâ€™s reform and opening up, the gap between rich and poor widened. This phenomenon caused individuals to experience mental stress. And I speculate that it may be the reason that the growth rate of life expectancy became lower since late 1970s.

>In general, because of the economic development and the elevation of the level of medical service after the Second World War, the life expectancies of countries in Asia rose dramatically. However, there are still some exceptions. The life expectancies of Iraq and DPRK declined rapidly. My speculation is that the main reason for the drop of life expectancy of Iraq is the Iraq war. As for DPRK, I think the main factors are food shortage and lack of medical service. The pattern of life expectancy for Cambodia also seems to be strange. The low life expectancy in 1950s may be because of the poor economic condition since its independence in 1953. And I think that the decline of life expectancy in 1970s is because of the civil war at that time. The dramatic rise in life expectancy may due to three reasons. First, the civil war was less severe because of the mediation of the United Nations. Second, the level of medical service elevated since 1979. Third, the amount of crop production almost doubled in the decade since 1979, which solved the problem of food shortage. We can also see an obvious outlier which is Afghanistan. I speculate that the low life expectancy of Afghanistan compared to other countries in Asia is due to the constant war, low level of medical service, poor economic condition, and food shortage. 

>As for life expectancies of countries in different continents, we can discover that in general, the life expectancies are higher in continents of Europe, Oceania, and Americas than in continents of Asia and Africa. The reason for that is that the countries in the former continents are relatively much more developed than in countries in the latter ones. Another discovery is that the life expectancies of countries in Americas and Asia are more diverse. The highest ones are more than 80, such as the life expectancy of Japan. However, the lowest ones are just above 60, and the life expectancy of Afghanistan is much lower. This is because of the imbalance of development for countries in Americas and Asia. And the feature of the life expectancies of countries in Africa is that the life expectancies of some countries experienced sudden drop. I think the outbreak of war, food shortage, and political instability are the main reasons.
