Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

Before we carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

```{r,skim_data}
#skim the data
skimr::skim(yrbss) 
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r, eda_on_weight}
#generate the density distribution of weights
ggplot(yrbss,aes(x=weight))+
geom_density()+
labs(title="the Histogram Distribution of Weight",
x="weight")

#generate summary statistics of weights
yrbss1<-yrbss%>%
summarise(mean_weight=mean(weight,na.rm=TRUE),
          min_weight=min(weight,na.rm=TRUE),
          max_weight=max(weight,na.rm=TRUE),
          med_weight=median(weight,na.rm=TRUE),
          sd_weight=sd(weight,na.rm=TRUE))
yrbss1

#check the numbers of missing observations
skim(yrbss)
```

> We are missing 1004 observations from weights.

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let’s create a new variable `physical_3plus`, which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise.

  
```{r}
yrbss <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >= 3, "yes", "no"))

yrbss %>% filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop= count/sum(count))

```

Let's provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week.

```{r,CI_propno}

propno_formula_ci<-yrbss %>%
# filter out the data that physical_3plus is NA
filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>%
#calculate the proportion of high schoolers that are not active
summarise(count =n(),
count_yes=count(physical_3plus == "yes"),
propno = 1-count_yes/count, 
#calculate the standard error of the proportion
se_propno = sqrt(propno*(1-propno)/count),
#calculate the t critical
t_critical = qt(0.95, count - 1),
# build the 95% confidence interval for the population proportion 
lower_bound = propno - t_critical * se_propno,
upper_bound = propno + t_critical * se_propno)
propno_formula_ci
```

  
Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. 

```{r, boxplot}
#filter out the data that physical_3plus is NA
yrbss1<-yrbss%>%
filter(!is.na(physical_3plus))

#make the boxplot of "physical_3plus" vs. "weight"
plot1<-ggplot(data = yrbss1, 
aes(x = physical_3plus, y = weight))+geom_boxplot()+
labs(title = "Relationship between physical active and weight",x = "physical active",y = "weight") +NULL

plot1
```

> High schoolers tend to have heavier weights when they are physically active for at least 3 days a week. I expect the opposite, which is that high schoolers tend to have lighter weights when they are physically active for at least 3 days a week. And the reason is that high schoolers may lose their weights by doing exercise frequently.

## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean/SD, etc weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.


```{r}
yrbss %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            se_weight = sd_weight/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_weight,
            lower = mean_weight - t_critical * se_weight,
            upper = mean_weight + t_critical * se_weight
            )

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.

> The null hypothesis is that the mean weights have no difference for those who exercise at least 3 times a week and those who don’t. And the alternative hypothesis is that the mean weights are different.

```{r}
t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```



## Hypothesis test with `infer`


Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r}
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```



Notice how we can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.

After we have initialized the test, we need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.


```{r}
null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```


Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

```


Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```


This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.
