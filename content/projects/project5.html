<h2>Biography of Pingchuan Tian</h2>
<p>My name is Pingchuan Tian, and I graduated from Tsinghua University, majoring in <strong>Japanese</strong>. And I also double majored in <strong>Economics</strong> in Peking University. I am an easygoing boy from <strong>Ningbo</strong>, a coastal city in China.You can learn more about my hometown at <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Ningbo" class="uri">https://wikitravel.org/en/Ningbo</a></p>
<p>I have various hobbies.</p>
<p>My hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li>swimming</li>
<li>playing basketball</li>
<li>playing badminton</li>
<li>investment</li>
<li>playing the piano</li>
</ul>
<p>But the one that deeply fascinates me is investment. I love investing in the stock market and purchasing funds. That is also the reason that I join the MFA program in LBS.</p>
<p>Although I am not a learning genius, I think studying is a pleasure and it can elevate my comprehensive quality. However, I don’t like exam that much. I am a perfectionist, so sometimes I also feel some pressure. In my spare time, I usually play badminton or play the piano. I believe these are good ways to release the pressure.</p>
<p>The study in LBS is undergoing, and I can’t wait seeing you guys in the beautiful campus! I believe we can become good friends and I am looking forward to our future journey in LBS.</p>
